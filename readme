LET’S GO GET HIGH – v0.0.1


LET’S GO GET HIGH is a 2-players-1-screen small videogame focused on “complementary cooperation”. 

Synopsis:
two little astronauts are forced to land on a unknown planet after a orbital incident.
Both their ships are heavily damaged and lack some primary vital gear.
Their main goal is to reach the sky again, together.


Game concept:
A series of mini-game levels focused on different cooperation concepts, like a forced “shared” camera, 
a you-move-i-shoot mechanic, a forced proximity or some other little tweak. This design is focused on forcing
the two player to act as one, in order to succeed. Game is intented to be a little funny time killer for two 
people sharing a room and a screen.
